//! Tool Loading Compatibility Test
//!
//! PURPOSE: Validates JSON tool configuration loading after discovering critical bug
//! where adding extra JSON files (status.json, await.json) broke test expectations.
//!
//! LESSON LEARNED: Tool loading tests are brittle to configuration changes.
//! - Only external CLI tools should have JSON configurations
//! - Hardwired MCP tools (status, await) don't need JSON files  
//! - But users may add them anyway for documentation/IDE support
//!
//! MAINTENANCE: Update expected counts when adding new CLI tool integrations
