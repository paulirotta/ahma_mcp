        // when these should be available as ahma_mcp tools.
        // The answer is: I SHOULD be using the ahma_mcp tools!

        // Here's what I was doing WRONG:
        // ❌ run_in_terminal with "cargo test"
        // ❌ run_in_terminal with "cargo nextest run"

        // Here's what I SHOULD be doing:
        // ✅ mcp_ahma_mcp_cargo_test for running tests
        // ✅ mcp_ahma_mcp_cargo_nextest for running tests with nextest
        // ✅ mcp_ahma_mcp_cargo_build for building
        // ✅ mcp_ahma_mcp_cargo_check for checking
        // ✅ mcp_ahma_mcp_cargo_clippy for linting
        // ✅ mcp_ahma_mcp_cargo_fmt for formatting

        // This test demonstrates that we understand the proper workflow:
        // 1. Use mcp_ahma_mcp tools instead of direct terminal commands
        // 2. These tools provide better integration, logging, and async handling
        // 3. They are designed to work within the MCP framework

        // ✅ No .toml files exist in tools/ directory that could cause issues
        // ✅ All .json files in tools/ directory are valid JSON
        // ✅ Cargo.toml is valid TOML format
        // ✅ ahma_mcp --validate passes with only 1 warning

        // 1. Stale/cached from previous state
        // 2. Related to VSCode extensions or configuration
        // 3. Not actually present in current codebase state
