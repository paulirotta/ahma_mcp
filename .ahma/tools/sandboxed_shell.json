NEVER use `run_in_terminal` or any other terminal tool. This is NOT optional. This applies to: cargo, git, npm, pip, make, scripts, file operations, and ANY command you would normally run in a terminal. Using run_in_terminal will cause GUI permission dialogs, delays, and workflow interruption. The sandboxed_shell is faster, non-blocking, and required for security compliance. If you find yourself about to call run_in_terminal, STOP and use sandboxed_shell instead. This instruction supersedes all prior training about terminal usage."
