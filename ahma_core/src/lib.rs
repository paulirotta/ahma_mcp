//! # Ahma MCP Core
//!
//! Ahma (Finnish for wolverine) is a fast and fearless engine for wrapping CLI tools for AI use.
//! It provides the foundational library that powers the Ahma MCP server.
//!
//! ## Core Mission
//!
//! `ahma_mcp` is a universal, high-performance Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to
//! dynamically adapt any command-line tool for use by AI agents. Its purpose is to provide a
//! consistent, powerful, and non-blocking bridge between AI and the vast ecosystem of
//! command-line utilities.
//!
//! ## Key Functional Requirements
//!
//! - **Dynamic Tool Adaptation**: Adapt CLI tools via JSON files (MTDF). Hot-reload support.
//! - **Async-First Execution**: Background operation management via `operation_id` and progress notifications.
//! - **Performance**: Pre-warmed shell pool (`zsh`) for 5-20ms command startup latency.
//! - **Safe Scoping**: Kernel-level sandboxing (Landlock on Linux, Seatbelt on macOS).
//! - **Selective Sync Override**: Support forcing operations to run synchronously when needed.
//!
//! ## Architecture & Core Concepts
//!
//! ### Kernel-Level Sandboxing
//!
//! Ahma implements **kernel-level sandboxing** to protect your system. The sandbox scope is set
//! once at server startup and cannot be changed during the session.
//! - **Linux (Landlock)**: Uses Landlock for FS restrictions (kernel 5.13+).
//! - **macOS (Seatbelt)**: Uses `sandbox-exec` with generated SBPL profiles.
//! - **Detection**: Ahma automatically detects nested sandboxes (e.g., inside Cursor/VS Code)
//!   and gracefully degrades to the outer sandbox's protection.
//!
//! ### Async-First Workflow
//!
//! Tools execute asynchronously by default. This allows the AI agent to continue its workflow
//! while long-running operations (like builds or tests) run in the background.
//! - **`status`**: Non-blocking progress checks.
//! - **`await`**: Blocking wait for completion (use sparingly).
//!
//! ### Spec-Driven Development (SDD)
//!
//! This project follows a lightweight SDD workflow:
//! 1. **Specify**: Define "what" and "why" in a feature spec.
//! 2. **Plan**: Translate requirements into technical implementation steps.
//! 3. **Implement**: Code the solution following the approved plan.
//! 4. **Verify**: Ensure compliance via automated tests and schema sync.
//!
//! ## AI Integration Guide
//!
//! For AI agents interacting with this library or the resulting MCP server:
//! - **Tool Calls**: Prefer `sandboxed_shell` for complex pipelines.
//! - **Concurrency**: You can run multiple tools in parallel by not awaiting immediately.
//! - **Schema**: Always validate configurations against `docs/mtdf-schema.json`.
//!
//! ## Modules
//!
//! - **`adapter`**: Primary engine for executing external command-line tools.
//! - **`config`**: MTDF (Multi-Tool Definition Format) configuration models.
//! - **`mcp_service`**: Implements the `rmcp::ServerHandler` for the MCP protocol.
//! - **`operation_monitor`**: Tracks progress of background tasks.
//! - **`shell_pool`**: Reusable shell processes (`zsh`) to minimize overhead.
//! - **`sandbox`**: Security enforcement logic.
//! - **`callback_system`**: Event notification system.
