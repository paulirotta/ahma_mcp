//! # Test: Async Operation Response Includes Tool Hints
//!
//! **Purpose:** Verify that when an asynchronous operation is started, the response
//! includes comprehensive guidance for the AI agent on how to handle it effectively.
//!
//! **Current Behavior (FAILING):** Response only says "Asynchronous operation started with ID: op_123"
//!
//! **Expected Behavior (SHOULD PASS AFTER FIX):** Response includes the full TOOL_HINT_TEMPLATE
//! with placeholders replaced:
//! - "ASYNC AHMA OPERATION:"
//! - The actual operation ID
//! - "Use `await` to block until operation ID(s) complete"
//! - "AVOID POLLING"
//! - Guidance on what to do while waiting
//!
//! **Why This Matters:**
//! Without these hints, AI agents don't know they should use the `await` tool.
//! They finish execution thinking the operation is complete, leading to false positives
//! where the AI reports success when tests/builds actually failed.
