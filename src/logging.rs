//! # Logging Configuration
//!
//! This module is responsible for setting up the logging infrastructure for the
//! application. It uses the `tracing` and `tracing_subscriber` crates to provide
//! structured, level-based logging.
//!
//! The setup is currently basic and can be extended to support more complex
//! logging requirements, such as directing logs to a file, integrating with
//! a log aggregation service, or customizing log formats.
