# "Canceled: Canceled" Investigation Log

## Issue Summary

Despite comprehensive fixes across multiple layers, "Canceled: Canceled" messages persist when using the MCP server. Direct cargo execution works fine.

## What We've Fixed (But Didn't Solve the Issue)

### 1. MCP Callback Layer (src/mcp_callback.rs)

- **Problem**: Format string `format!("Cancelled: {message}")` created duplication
- **Fix**: Enhanced message formatting to detect existing cancellation indicators
- **Result**: Should prevent "Cancelled: Canceled" but issue persists

### 2. Adapter Layer (src/adapter.rs)

- **Problem**: Process output parsing with generic cancellation detection
- **Fix**: Enhanced cancellation patterns and rmcp ServiceError detection
- **Result**: Better cancellation detection but core issue remains

### 3. Main CLI Layer (src/main.rs)

- **Problem**: Generic error handling for cancellation events
- **Fix**: Signal-based shutdown reasons and enhanced rmcp error handling
- **Result**: Better error context but issue persists

### 4. Operation Monitor (src/operation_monitor.rs)

- **Problem**: Basic cancellation reason storage
- **Fix**: Structured cancellation data with reason preservation
- **Result**: Better tracking but doesn't address message source

### 5. MCP Protocol Handler (src/mcp_service.rs)

- **Problem**: Missing MCP client cancellation handling
- **Fix**: Added ServerHandler.on_cancelled method for protocol-level cancellations
- **Result**: Handles VS Code cancellations but issue persists

## Current Evidence

### User Test Results

- Direct `cargo nextest run --workspace` works fine
- MCP server execution: `cargo run --bin ahma_mcp -- --tools-dir tools cargo_nextest default --workspace` fails with "Canceled: Canceled"
- Tool validation via MCP server works: `cargo run --bin ahma_mcp -- --tools-dir tools --validate tools`

### Key Insight

The issue appears to be **tool-execution specific**, not general MCP protocol or cancellation handling.

## Potential Root Causes Not Yet Investigated

### 1. Tools JSON Configuration Issues

- Tool parameter validation might generate cancellation messages
- Command construction from JSON might introduce issues
- Schema validation failures might trigger cancellations

### 2. Shell Execution Layer (shell_pool.rs)

- Process spawning and management might have independent cancellation handling
- Command timeout handling might generate "Canceled" messages
- Signal propagation to child processes might create duplicate messages

### 3. Command Construction and Execution

- The way we build commands from JSON tool definitions
- Parameter processing and validation before execution
- Error handling during command preparation

### 4. External Process Behavior

- cargo nextest itself might be generating "Canceled" messages
- Process signals (SIGTERM, SIGINT) might cause external tools to report cancellation
- Race conditions between our cancellation and external process responses

## Investigation Plan

1. **Check tools/ JSON files** - Look for patterns that might cause cancellation issues
2. **Get actual error output** - Examine the terminal output from the failed nextest run
3. **Trace shell_pool.rs** - Check if the shell execution layer has independent cancellation handling
4. **Test with simpler tools** - See if the issue is specific to cargo nextest or affects all tools
5. **Check rmcp library source** - The cancellation might be coming from the underlying MCP library

## Hypothesis

The "Canceled: Canceled" message is likely being generated by:

1. The external process (cargo nextest) itself when it receives termination signals
2. The shell execution layer (shell_pool.rs) reporting process cancellation
3. Tool parameter validation or command construction failures
4. Multiple cancellation sources creating a cascade effect

The fact that direct execution works but MCP execution fails suggests the issue is in our tool execution pipeline, not the underlying cargo nextest command.
