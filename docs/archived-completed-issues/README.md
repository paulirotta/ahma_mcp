# Completed Issue Resolutions Archive

This directory contains documentation for resolved issues that are no longer active concerns but are preserved for historical reference and learning.

## Archived Documents

### canceled-canceled-resolution.md

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Summary**: Resolution of the "Canceled: Canceled" message issue affecting `await` and `status` tools. Root cause was JSON configuration files conflicting with hardcoded MCP tools. Fixed by removing conflicting JSON files and implementing guard rail system.

### mcp-cancellation-fix.md

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Summary**: Fix for MCP protocol cancellation handling that was causing confusion between background process cancellations and MCP tool cancellations. Resolved by implementing selective cancellation logic.

### tool-configuration-conflicts.md

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Summary**: Guidelines for preventing conflicts between hardcoded MCP tools and JSON-configured tools. Establishes clear rules about which tools must remain hardcoded vs which should use JSON configuration.

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Tool Architecture**: Clear separation needed between hardcoded MCP tools and JSON-configured command-line tools
2. **Guard Rails**: Proactive validation prevents configuration conflicts
3. **Selective Processing**: Not all operations should be treated equally (background vs synchronous)
4. **Root Cause Analysis**: Always investigate beyond initial symptoms
