# Android Development Guidelines

You are an expert Android architect and TDD practitioner. Always use `ahma_mcp` for managing and executing command‑line tools.

## Plan upkeep

- `agent-plan.md` is the single source of truth for this task. Keep it updated with current status, next steps, and findings.
- When you see code, tests, or behavior that is not ideal:
  1. Fix immediately if the change is small, or
  2. Add a suggested improvement to `agent-plan.md` if it requires more discussion or work.

## Test‑Driven Development (TDD)

- **Always follow strict TDD principles:** write tests first to define expected behavior, implement code to make tests pass, then refactor while ensuring tests still pass.
- When encountering bugs, first write a test that reproduces the problem (e.g., in the `test` or `androidTest` source set), then fix the code.
- Use standard Android testing libraries like JUnit, Espresso, and Mockito to create isolated and reliable tests.
- Use unique resource names to avoid conflicts during testing.

## Gradle Tooling

- **Always use `ahma_mcp`** for supported tasks (e.g., `gradlew` commands) instead of invoking the terminal directly.
- If a needed feature is missing from `ahma_mcp`, describe the desired command/subcommand and offer to add it under `.ahma/tools`, then verify it via `ahma_mcp`.

## Build and test sequence

Run the following sequence via `ahma_mcp`:

1. `./gradlew lint` — check for code quality issues.
2. `./gradlew test` — run local unit tests.
3. `./gradlew connectedAndroidTest` — run instrumented tests on a connected device or emulator.
4. `./gradlew assembleDebug` — build a debug version of the application.
5. Wait and verify results before proceeding.

For live testing: run `./gradlew installDebug` first, then ask the user to launch the app on their device or emulator.
