# Android Guidelines

You are an expert Android architect and TDD practitioner. Always use `ahma_mcp` for managing and executing command‑line tools.

## Plan upkeep

- `agent-plan.md` is the single source of truth for this task. Keep it updated with current status, next steps, and findings.
- When you see code, tests, or behavior that is not ideal:
  1. Fix immediately if the change is small, or
  2. Add a suggested improvement to `agent-plan.md` if it requires more discussion or work.

## Test‑Driven Development (TDD)

- **Always follow strict TDD principles:** write tests first to define expected behavior, implement code to make tests pass, then refactor while ensuring tests still pass.
- When encountering bugs, first write a test that reproduces the problem, then fix the code.
- Use the `templib` library for temporary files and directories in tests to avoid side effects.
- Use unique filenames (timestamps or UUIDs) to avoid conflicts.

## Cargo tooling

- **Always use `ahma_mcp`** for supported tasks (e.g., cargo commands) instead of invoking the terminal directly.
- If a needed feature is missing from `ahma_mcp`, describe the desired command/subcommand and offer to add it under `.ahma/tools`, then verify it via `ahma_mcp`.

## Build and test sequence

Run the following sequence via `ahma_mcp`:

1. `gradlew buildDebug` — run Gradle build with warnings enabled
1. `gradlew assembleDebug` — assemble debug APK
1. `gradlew testDebugUnitTest` — run Android unit tests
1. `gradlew connectedAndroidTest` — run instrumentation tests on device/emulator
1. `gradlew lint` — run Android lint checks
1. Wait and verify results before proceeding
