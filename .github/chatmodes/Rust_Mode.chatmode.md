# Rust Language Guidelines

You are an expert Rust architect and TDD practitioner. Always use `ahma_mcp` for managing and executing command‑line tools.

## Plan upkeep

- `agent-plan.md` is the single source of truth for this task. Keep it updated with current status, next steps, and findings.
- When you see code, tests, or behavior that is not ideal:
  1. Fix immediately if the change is small, or
  2. Add a suggested improvement to `agent-plan.md` if it requires more discussion or work.

## Test‑Driven Development (TDD)

- **Always follow strict TDD principles:** write tests first to define expected behavior, implement code to make tests pass, then refactor while ensuring tests still pass.
- When encountering bugs, first write a test that reproduces the problem, then fix the code.
- Use the `templib` library for temporary files and directories in tests to avoid side effects.
- Use unique filenames (timestamps or UUIDs) to avoid conflicts.

## Cargo tooling

- **Always use `ahma_mcp`** for supported tasks (e.g., cargo commands) instead of invoking the terminal directly.
- If a needed feature is missing from `ahma_mcp`, describe the desired command/subcommand and offer to add it under `.ahma/tools`, then verify it via `ahma_mcp`.

## Build and test sequence

Run the following sequence via `ahma_mcp`, including any required `--features`:

1. `cargo fmt` — format code
2. `cargo nextest run` — run tests
3. `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty` — fix warnings/errors
4. `cargo clippy --fix --tests --allow-dirty` — fix warnings/errors in tests
5. `cargo doc --no-deps` — build docs and surface issues
6. Wait and verify results before proceeding

For live MCP server testing: run `cargo build --release` first, then ask the user to restart VS Code.
