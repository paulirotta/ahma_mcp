Ahma MCP is
- **secure by default**: toolbox for AI to use command line tools safely, a way to move past the  'do you trust this tool/author?' prompts. Trust is not a security model.
- **fast by default**: command line tool calls become *deterministic and asynchronous subagents*. This saves time by allowing AI agents to continue thinking and planning while awaiting one or more long-running command line tasks.
- **principle of least privilege (PoLP)**: You may optionally disalbe direct calls to `sandboxed_shell` and instead specify the allowed arguments to each command line tool by creating a `.ahma/toolname.json` file.
- **batteries included**: Bundled tools can be selectively enabled, e.g. `--simplify` in your `mcp.json` for vibe code complexity reduction to improve maintainability.
- **flexible**: Supporting agentic development workflows or powering business agents are just two use cases. The rest is up to your creative imagination.
- **actively developed**: We are currently adding features like progressive tool disclosure and live log monitoring to proactively inform AI agents of issues as they occur.

### What Ahma does

MCP Clients such as developer IDEs and CLIs(Antigravity, Claude, Codex, Cursor, Open Code, Roo, VS Code, etc.) often have a built-in terminal that the AI can use. That terminal is powerful but often difficult or option to restrict for safe AI use with reduced blast radius. Business agent frameworks often do not offer a terminal. Ahma complements these tools by adding security and async execution:

| Capability | Native IDE/CLI terminal | Ahma `sandboxed_shell` |
|---|---|---|
| **Write protection** | None — full filesystem access | Kernel-enforced to workspace only (Seatbelt on macOS, Landlock on Linux) |
| **Async execution** | Synchronous — AI blocks until done | Async-first — AI continues working while commands run in background |
| **Parallel operations** | Sequential tool calls | True concurrent operations with per-operation status tracking |
| **Structured tool schema** | Raw shell strings | Typed parameters, validation, subcommands via `.ahma/*.json` |
| **Progressive disclosure** | All tools always listed | Bundles revealed on demand — preserves AI context window |
| **Live log monitoring** | Raw output only | Pattern-matched alerts streamed to AI (error/warn/info levels) |
| **PoLP enforcement** | Any command, any argument | Optionally restrict to declared arguments per tool |

## Supported OS

Linux and MacOS are supported. Windows is not supported. Raspberry Pi is supported with `--no-sandbox` until the kernel is updated to support Landlock (kernel ≥ 5.13).

## Installation Script

The installation script will:
1. Detects your OS and architecture
2. Downloads the latest release from GitHub
3. Installs `ahma_mcp` and `ahma_simplify` to `~/.local/bin`

Ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your `PATH`.

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulirotta/ahma_mcp/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

## Source Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulirotta/ahma_mcp.git
cd ahma_mcp
cargo build --release
mv target/release/ahma_mcp /usr/local/bin/
mv target/release/ahma_simplify /usr/local/bin/
```

## Concepts

If you are an AI agent interacting with this repository:
- **Sandbox Boundary**: You have full access within `${workspaceFolder}` but zero access outside it. Use `sandboxed_shell` for multi-step tasks.
- **Async Concurrency**: Most tools are async by default. Use `status` to monitor progress and continue with other tasks.
- **MTDF Schema**: Reference [docs/mtdf-schema.json](docs/mtdf-schema.json) defines the schema for creating or modifying tool configurations in `.ahma/*.json`.

## Key Features

- **Kernel-Level Sandboxing**: Security by default. Hard kernel boundaries prevent accessing any files outside the workspace, regardless of how an AI constructs its commands.
- **Asynchronous By Default with Sync Override**: Operations run asynchronously by default, allowing the LLM to continue work while awaiting results. Use `--sync` flag or set `"synchronous": true` in tool config for operations that must complete before proceeding. Supports multiple concurrent long-running operations (builds, tests).
- **Easy Tool Definition**: Add any command-line tool to your AI's arsenal by creating a single JSON file. No recompilation needed.
- **Multi-Step Workflows (Preferred)**: Run multi-command pipelines via `sandboxed_shell` (e.g., `cargo fmt --all && cargo clippy --all-targets && cargo test`).

## Security Sandbox

Security by default is a project core value. Unlike other tools that "yolo" system access or rely on easily bypassed string filters, Ahma MCP enforces hard kernel-level boundaries. The sandbox scope is set once at server startup and cannot be changed during the session—the AI has full access within the sandbox but zero access outside it.

### Why Kernel-Level Sandboxing?

Security by default is a core value of this project. While other tools rely on fragile string-based filtering that AI can easily bypass, Ahma MCP enforces hard kernel-level boundaries that cannot be circumvented. This prevents "yolo" security risks where users might otherwise trust an AI with broad system access.

### Sandbox Scope

The sandbox scope defines the root directory boundary for all file system operations:

- **STDIO mode**: Defaults to the current working directory when the server starts. The IDE sets `cwd` in `mcp.json` to `${workspaceFolder}`, so this "just works".
- **HTTP mode**: Set once when the HTTP server starts (cannot be changed during session). Configure via:
  1. `--sandbox-scope <path>` command-line parameter (highest priority)
  2. `AHMA_SANDBOX_SCOPE` environment variable
  3. Current working directory when server starts (default)
- **Single sandbox per server**: In HTTP mode, all clients share the same sandbox. For multiple projects, run separate server instances.

### Platform-Specific Enforcement

#### Linux (Landlock)

On Linux, Ahma uses [Landlock](https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/landlock.html) for kernel-level file system sandboxing. No additional installation is required—Landlock is built into Linux kernels 5.13 and newer.

**Requirements**: 
- **Linux kernel 5.13 or newer** (released June 2021)
- The server will **refuse to start** on older kernels unless sandbox is explicitly disabled
- For legacy kernels, you can run with `--no-sandbox` or `AHMA_NO_SANDBOX=1`; Ahma logs a warning and runs without its internal sandbox
- Check your kernel version with: `uname -r`

#### Raspberry Pi and Older Kernels

Some platforms (notably older Raspberry Pi OS kernels) ship with kernels that
do not support the Landlock LSM required for Ahma's Linux sandboxing. If your
kernel is older than 5.13 or `/sys/kernel/security/lsm` does not list
`landlock`, Ahma's kernel-enforced sandbox cannot be applied.

Recommended options when running on such systems:

- Quick check (shows kernel):

```bash
uname -r
cat /sys/kernel/security/lsm  # optional - shows active LSMs
```

- Run Ahma in compatibility (unsandboxed) mode explicitly using the env var
  or CLI flag. This makes the system usable on older kernels but disables
  Ahma's internal sandbox protections.

```bash
# Environment variable (preferred for mcp.json / CI setups)
export AHMA_NO_SANDBOX=1
ahma_mcp --mode http --tools-dir .ahma

# Or use the CLI flag
ahma_mcp --no-sandbox --mode http --tools-dir .ahma
```

- **Raspberry Pi OS**: Older kernels (pre-5.13) do not support Landlock. Ahma requires `--no-sandbox` (or `AHMA_NO_SANDBOX=1`) until the kernel is upgraded to a version that supports Landlock.

Security note: running with `AHMA_NO_SANDBOX=1` or `--no-sandbox` disables
Ahma's kernel-level protections. Only use this mode on machines that are
already sandboxed or otherwise trusted (for example, inside a container or
managed development environment). Prefer upgrading the kernel to 5.13+ where
possible to restore full Landlock enforcement.

#### macOS (Seatbelt/sandbox-exec)

On macOS, Ahma uses Apple's built-in `sandbox-exec` with [Seatbelt profiles](https://reverse.put.as/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Apple-Sandbox-Guide-v1.0.pdf) for kernel-level file system sandboxing. No additional installation is required—`sandbox-exec` is built into macOS.

**Requirements**: Any modern version of macOS. The server generates a Seatbelt profile (SBPL) that restricts write access to only the sandbox scope.

### Nested Sandbox Environments (Cursor, VS Code, Docker)

When running inside another sandboxed environment (like Cursor IDE, VS Code, or Docker), Ahma automatically detects that it cannot apply its own sandbox. By default, Ahma exits with clear instructions to explicitly disable its internal sandbox. This is because:

- **Cursor/VS Code**: These IDEs sandbox MCP servers, preventing nested `sandbox-exec` calls on macOS
- **Docker**: Containers may restrict the system calls needed for sandboxing

**Auto-detection**: Ahma tests if `sandbox-exec` can be applied at startup. If it detects a nested sandbox, it fails fast with guidance to use `--no-sandbox` or `AHMA_NO_SANDBOX=1`.

**Manual override**: You can also explicitly disable Ahma's sandbox:

```bash
# Via command-line flag
ahma_mcp --no-sandbox

# Via environment variable (useful for mcp.json configuration)
export AHMA_NO_SANDBOX=1
ahma_mcp
```

Example `mcp.json` for Cursor/VS Code:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "Ahma": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "ahma_mcp",
      "args": ["--tools-dir", ".ahma/tools"]
    }
  }
}
```

Antigravity does not send the working directory in 'roots' so sandbox scoping must be manual or '--disable-sandbox'

Example `mcp.json` for Antigravity:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Ahma": {
      "command": "bash",
      "args": [
        "-c",
        "ahma_mcp --simplify --rust --sandbox-scope $HOME/github"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## MCP Server Connection Modes

`ahma_mcp` supports three modes of operation:

### 1. STDIO Mode (Default)

Direct MCP server over stdio for integration with MCP clients:

```bash
ahma_mcp --mode stdio --tools-dir ./tools
```

### 2. HTTP Bridge Mode

HTTP server that proxies requests to the stdio MCP server:

```bash
# Start HTTP bridge on default port (3000)
# Clients that provide roots/list can lock sandbox from roots
ahma_mcp --mode http

# Explicit sandbox scope for clients like Antigravity and LM Studio that do not send roots/list
ahma_mcp --mode http --sandbox-scope /path/to/your/project

# Or via environment variable
export AHMA_SANDBOX_SCOPE=/path/to/your/project
ahma_mcp --mode http

# Custom port
ahma_mcp --mode http --http-port 8080 --http-host 127.0.0.1
```

**Important**: In HTTP mode, sandbox scope is bound **per client session** via the MCP `roots/list` protocol.
If a client does not provide roots/list, you **must** configure an explicit scope via `--sandbox-scope` or `AHMA_SANDBOX_SCOPE`.

**Security Note**: HTTP mode is for local development only. Do not expose to untrusted networks.

Send JSON-RPC requests to `http://localhost:3000/mcp`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'
```
