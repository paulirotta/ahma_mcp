# Agent Plan

## Current Objectives

1. Update TDD coverage to reflect merged cargo tool (adjust existing tests, add new availability tests).
2. Add failing tests for startup availability detection and install guidance logging.
3. Refactor configurations and implementation to satisfy new tests, keeping logs and schemas aligned.

## Notes

- Strict TDD: ensure failing tests exist before implementation.
- Keep requirements.md constraints in mind, especially MCP tool usage policies.
